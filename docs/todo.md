## Modelling

* Intercontinental issues - much better but still iffy
    * How sensitive are we to the continent initialisation thing?
* Do we get better results if we account for uncertainty in predictions?
    * Teams are consistently underperforming expected goals... shouldn't it be the other way around?
* Init variance higher, or need to make predictions with variance into account - cannot say northern mariana islands were almost zero chance to lose by so much
* Should not be able to expect more than some number of goals
* Let's use cross variance
    * Looks good! Optimise it some more...

## Design

* Need some more flags for the current non FIFA members we added...
* Need bigger flags, probably
