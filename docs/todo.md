## Modelling

* Init variance higher, or need to make predictions with variance into account - cannot say northern mariana islands were almost zero chance to lose by so much
* Should not be able to expect more than some number of goals
* Let's use cross variance
    * Looks good! Optimise it some more...
    * Actually! Important!! It looks like higher cross var is very similar to higher var, which we know improves things a bit at the cost of some diagnostics... work out what you really want here.

## Design

* Need some more flags for the current non FIFA members we added...
* Need bigger flags, probably

## Misc

* Automatically download stuff
